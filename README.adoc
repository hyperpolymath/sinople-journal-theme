*Alt-journal WordPress theme for the fog-bound, stitched, and emotionally intricate. Built CSS-first with WCAG 2.3 AAA compliance, IndieWeb integration, ARIA-rich semantics, and structured data via JSON-LD and Open Graph. A vessel for storytelling, resistance, and poetic presence.*

---

== 🧶 Overview

*Sinople* is a narrative environment for layered expression. It's named after a heraldic pigment once red, now green - an emblem of contradiction and agency. This theme transforms WordPress into a mist-soaked loom for thoughts, threads, and constructs. CSS-first by design, it privileges performance, readability, and symbolic structure while embracing radical inclusivity and decentralized publishing.

== ✨ Key Features

- *CSS-First Architecture*  
  Fast-rendering, mobile-responsive, fully declarative stylesheets. Minimal JS footprint for accessibility enhancements only.

- *WCAG 2.3 AAA Compliance*  
  Visible focus indicators, skip links, font controls, dark/light mode toggle, motion sensitivity respect, and semantic HTML throughout.

- *ARIA & Semantic HTML*  
  Meaningful landmarks (`main`, `navigation`, `banner`), structured role attributes, and keyboard navigation tailored for all readers.

- *IndieWeb Integration*  
  - Microformats v2: `h-entry`, `h-card`, `p-name`, etc.  
  - Webmention ready  
  - Post Kinds support (note, reply, bookmark)  
  - POSSE and `u-syndication` links

- *Structured Metadata Layer*  
  Uses *JSON-LD with schema.org* for search engine clarity and semantic depth. Entities are expressed via `@graph` blocks and can later be extended with FOAF or SKOS vocabularies.

- *Open Graph Metadata*  
  Embedded in `<head>` to ensure rich previews when posts are shared across social platforms. Complements structured data with visual affinity.

- *Spans & Constructs*  
  Native support for:
  - *Field Notes*: observational micro-essays  
  - *Characters & Constructs*: symbolic entities like *Eteri Mistveil*  
  - *Threaded Archives*: entries sorted by color, emotional tone, or mythic motif  
  - *Glosses*: footnotes with `aria-describedby`  
  - *Portals*: annotated external inspirations

📜 Licensing
GPL v3 for all code — open-source, remixable, and ethically grounded

CC BY 4.0 for narrative, poetic, or visual assets (unless otherwise stated)

Dual licensing for ontological data (sinople.ttl, metadata.jsonld) to clarify reuse in structured or linked data contexts

💬 Semantic & Ontological Notes
Sinople embraces structured data as symbolic artifact. Each span may include:

🔗 JSON-LD blocks using Article, Person, or custom types

🖼️ Open Graph meta tags to enrich social previews (og:title, og:image, etc.)

🧵 Optional RDFa inline markup for glosses and threaded constructs

🧬 Future VoID and OWL support to publish symbolic entities as Linked Data

These layers are modular and can be added or extended as the journal's semantic weave evolves.

🚀 Getting Started
Clone into your theme directory:

<pre>

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sinople-theme.git

</pre>

Then: 

- Activate via WordPress Admin  
- Install IndieWeb plugins: Webmention, Post Kinds, IndieAuth  
- Customize spans via CSS modules and semantic templates

♿ Accessibility Commitment
Sinople is built with care for all modes of reading:

✅ Screen reader–friendly

✅ Keyboard navigable

✅ Motion-respecting

✅ Braille-compatible flow

✅ Semantic hierarchy and visible focus indicators

Accessibility is not an afterthought - it’s woven into the theme’s voice.
